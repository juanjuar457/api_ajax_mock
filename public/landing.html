			<p>This web app is an order form for the compounding pharmacy I work in, It replaces a white board where <br>
			 each individual material/ingredient would have to be hand written.</p> 
			 
			 <p>Order for later solves the inconvience of the white board by allowing users to simply visit a link and input<br> their requested materials and have them stored on a database. Version 1 allows for entry of up to 100 items and<br> 
			 a delete button for any material added, everything added/ removed is active to the server!Order for later also<br>
			 allows highlighting to indicate backorder of a particular materials with 1 click!

<p>The downside is the limited space and inconvenince of having to drop what you're doing to add something to<br>theboard. Also when many items are on the board keeping track of them becomes an issue.</p><br> -->
